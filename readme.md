# Lorentz Attractor Visualization

A 3D visualization of the Lorenz attractor system using Three.js. The project renders an interactive coordinate system with a Lorenz attractor trajectory.

## Features

- 3D coordinate system with labeled X, Y, Z axes
- Interactive orbit controls for camera movement
- Real-time Lorenz attractor simulation
- Axis tick marks and numerical labels
- Responsive design that adapts to window size

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lorentz-attractor-visualization.git
```

## Controls

- **Orbit**: Click and drag to rotate view
- **Zoom**: Mouse wheel to zoom in/out
- **Pan**: Right click and drag to pan

## Configuration

The Lorenz system parameters can be modified in `main.js`:
